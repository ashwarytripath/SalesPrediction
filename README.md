## Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning in Python

### Overview
Sales prediction involves forecasting product sales based on factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. This project aims to optimize advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

### Dataset
The dataset includes historical sales data and related features:
- Features: Advertising Expenditure, Target Audience Demographics, Advertising Platform Details
- Target: Sales Volume

### Approach
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features and create new features if needed to improve model performance.

3. **Model Building**: Implement regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression) to predict sales volume.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess performance.

### Results
The final model achieves 90.59% accuracy on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting product sales based on advertising strategies.
